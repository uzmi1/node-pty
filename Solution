To troubleshoot socket connections to ConPTY in the Rust-Port branch, you must first ensure that the named pipeline is properly installed and connected to child processes. Here's how to fix the problem:

Named Pipe Creation Verification: Look at the code that handles the design of named pipes in native Rust implementations. Make sure the pipes have good security features and are safe for children to use.

Creating a diagnostic procedure: when making a dent in a child's table Ensure that the standard input/output ring is correctly routed to the named pipe. This can be done using the function CreateProcess With the appropriate STARTUPINFO settings

Error Handling: Use robust error handling to catch any failures. During pipeline connection This will help identify where the relationship has broken down.

Look at the C code: since you said the main branch has the corresponding C code. Lets compare the Rust implementation with C code to compare the differences in pipeline and process management.

Testing : After making changes. Run the provided commands (tree build:native, tree build, tree test) to see if the changes fix the failed tests.

Here's a simple example. Here's how to set up a pipeline in Rust:

use std::os::windows::io::{AsRawHandle, FromRawHandle};
use std::process::{Stdio command};

let (child_stdin, child_stdout) = open_name_pipes()?;
Let mut child = Command::new("your_child_pattern") .
    .stdin(Stdio::from_raw_handle(child_stdin.as_raw_handle())) .
    .stdout(Stdio::from_raw_handle(child_stdout.as_raw_handle())) .
    .spawn()?;
